About OpenStack-In-A-Box
========================

OpenStackInABox initially started out as modules that were an integrated part
of StackInABox_. However, it soon became clear that StackInABox_ was a really
valuable project by itself, and the OpenStack Services implemented on top of
it should be a separate project. With some minor refactoring the two were
split apart.
